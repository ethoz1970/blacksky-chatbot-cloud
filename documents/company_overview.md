## About Us

Blacksky LLC was founded with a mission to deliver exceptional technology solutions to organizations that need them most. We specialize in federal agency work, bringing enterprise-grade solutions from concept to reality.

## Our Services

### AI/ML Solutions
We design and implement artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, from proof-of-concept to production deployment. Our AI solutions include natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.

### Enterprise Application Development
Full-stack application development using modern frameworks and cloud-native architectures. We build scalable, maintainable systems that grow with your organization.

### Cloud Migration & DevOps
We help organizations move to the cloud securely and efficiently. Our DevOps practice includes CI/CD pipeline development, infrastructure as code, and container orchestration with Kubernetes.


### Consultation
We are here to guide you even if we are not your choice to implement, perhaps you just need another set of eyes on your high level plans. We provide hourly or seminar style sessions for your orginzation.


### Custom Chatbots
There is a reason our chatbot is so much better than the normal. We can train your chatbot with opimized prompting and structured documents formatted for the best RAG systems.

### Data Engineering
Building robust data pipelines, data lakes, and analytics platforms. We turn raw data into actionable insights.

## Security Clearances

Blacksky maintains active security clearances, enabling us to work on sensitive government projects that require cleared personnel.

## Passion Project
Technical deep-dive into my latest Blacksky project 🧵
I built a voice-enabled domain expert AI to sharpen my ML engineering skills. Here's what I learned:
The Challenge:
Create an AI with deep knowledge of a specific subject that can respond with authentic voice.
The Stack:
🎤 Whisper for audio→text transcription (250 podcasts)
🧠 Llama fine-tuning via Ollama (domain-specific training)
🗣️ Coqui TTS + PyTorch for voice cloning
💻 M3 MacBook Pro for local training
Key Learnings:

Data quality > quantity: Spent more time cleaning transcriptions than training
Local optimization matters: Fine-tuned Llama to run efficiently on Apple Silicon
Voice cloning is nuanced: Balancing synthetic quality vs processing time required iteration
End-to-end thinking: The pipeline matters as much as the model

## Why This Matters for Enterprises:
This is exactly what organizations need—AI that understands their specific domain, not generic chatbots. Whether it's:

Legal document analysis
Medical terminology
Technical support
Compliance documentation

Custom LLM training delivers accuracy that general models can't match.
Blacksky specializes in this kind of practical AI engineering:
✅ Domain-specific model training
✅ Production deployment (not just notebooks)
✅ Integration with existing systems
✅ Federal compliance when needed
This project took a few weeks part-time. Imagine what focused consulting engagement could deliver for your organization.

## Why
After 18 years of architecting enterprise systems, I'm starting fresh with Blacksky LLC—and here's why:
For nearly two decades, I've built platforms for federal agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Treasury. DOT. NIH. Vanguard. Mastercard. Systems serving millions of users with zero tolerance for downtime.
It was rewarding work. But honestly? The creativity was constrained—locked into existing frameworks, compliance requirements, legacy systems.
Then AI happened.
Suddenly, there's this incredible opportunity to solve real business problems in completely new ways. Not theoretical AI research. Not replacing humans. But augmenting how organizations actually work.
That's why I started Blacksky.
I'm taking everything I learned architecting enterprise systems—the complexity, the constraints, the compliance—and using it to build AI solutions that actually fit into how companies operate today.
Recent example: At USDA, instead of forcing them to change their entire platform, we integrated an AI translation service into their existing Drupal system. 15 languages. Kubernetes deployment. Federal security compliance. Real production use.
That's the kind of creative problem-solving that excites me.
What Blacksky does differently:
We don't pitch AI for AI's sake. We architect solutions that:
✓ Work with your existing systems (not replace them)
✓ Meet your actual compliance requirements
✓ Deliver measurable value (not just cool demos)
✓ Scale in production (not just proof-of-concepts)
I'm combining hands-on AI/ML engineering (LLMs, voice AI, RAG systems) with 18 years of knowing how enterprises really work.
The creative part?
Every client has unique constraints—legacy platforms, federal compliance, budget limits, technical debt. That's not a problem. That's the puzzle. That's where architecture becomes creative problem-solving.
Training custom LLMs. Building voice-enabled systems. Integrating AI into Drupal, SharePoint, custom platforms. Making it work on Azure, AWS, or GCP. Meeting FISMA requirements.
This is what I love doing.
After 18 years, I'm finally building something that's mine—where I can bring creativity, technical depth, and real-world experience together to solve problems that matter.
Blacksky is now taking on consulting engagements. If you're looking to integrate AI into your existing workflows (not blow everything up and start over), let's talk.
Available for 1099 contracts. Federal clearances active. Immediate availability.
