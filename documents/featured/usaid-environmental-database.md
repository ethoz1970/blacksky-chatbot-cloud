# USAID Environmental Database Modernization Project

## Overview

Led the complete architectural transformation of USAID's environmental compliance database as Lead Software Architect, modernizing a legacy PHP application into an enterprise-grade Drupal 10 platform. The system serves critical environmental compliance data for international development projects worldwide. Delivered under budget and ahead of schedule.

## The Challenge

USAID's environmental compliance database was a legacy PHP application with minimal documentation. The system needed modernization to handle 50,000+ environmental compliance records with better performance, search capabilities, and integration with external government systems.

## Blacksky's Approach

**Solo Reverse Engineering (First 7 Months)**
- Independently reverse-engineered legacy PHP application with minimal documentation
- Analyzed existing codebase, database schema, and business logic
- Created comprehensive migration strategy based on reverse engineering findings
- Built core backend infrastructure and system architecture single-handedly

**Microservices Integration Architecture**
- Designed microservices-based integration layer connecting multiple external APIs
- Centralized data platform eliminating manual synchronization workflows
- Achieved 75% reduction in data latency across all integrated systems

**Enterprise Search Infrastructure**
- Architected Apache Solr search solution for complex environmental dataset queries
- Delivered sub-second response times across 50,000+ records
- Enabled advanced filtering and faceted search for compliance data

**Team Leadership (Final 4 Months)**
- Successfully advocated for additional resources through ICF/USAID
- Led team of 2 (front-end engineer + junior developer) to complete contract deliverables
- Established code review standards achieving 60% reduction in production defects

## Key Accomplishments

- **75% data latency reduction** through microservices integration architecture
- **60% reduction in production defects** through quality leadership
- **Sub-second search** across 50,000+ environmental compliance records
- **Zero data loss** during complete platform migration
- **On-time, under-budget delivery** of complex federal modernization

## Technologies

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| CMS Platform | Drupal 10 |
| Backend | PHP |
| Search | Apache Solr |
| Hosting | Acquia Cloud |
| Architecture | Microservices-based API integrations |

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates Blacksky's ability to:

- **Independently tackle complex challenges** - 7 months of solo reverse engineering and development
- **Work with prime contractors** - Effective collaboration with ICF on federal engagement
- **Scale execution** - Successfully transitioned from solo architect to team director mid-project
- **Deliver federal projects** - Complex modernization delivered on time and under budget

For organizations with legacy systems needing modernization, this project proves Blacksky can reverse-engineer undocumented systems, architect modern replacements, and deliver results both independently and as a team leader.
