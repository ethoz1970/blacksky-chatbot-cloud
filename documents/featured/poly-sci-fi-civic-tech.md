# Poly Sci Fi - Civic Technology Platform

## Overview

Poly Sci Fi is a civic technology platform designed to transform passive news consumers into active participants in democracy. It tracks every member of Congress in real-time and is designed to become a political social network for civic engagement. Not left or right - just engaged.

## The Vision

Democracy shouldn't be a spectator sport. Most Americans consume political news passively - scrolling headlines, feeling outraged or helpless, then moving on. The gap between "being informed" and "taking action" is where civic participation dies.

Poly Sci Fi provides the tools for citizens to:
- **Connect** with others who share their concerns
- **Organize** around issues that matter to them
- **Hold representatives accountable** with real data, not partisan spin

## Current Features

The platform is live with core functionality:

- **Real-time congressional tracking** - All 535 members of Congress monitored continuously
- **Live updates** - Direct integration with Congress.gov API for current legislative activity
- **Member profiles** - Voting records, positions, committee assignments, and accountability metrics
- **News tracking** - Aggregated coverage and activity for each representative

## Planned Features

The roadmap includes AI-powered civic engagement tools:

- **Social networking** - Connect with constituents, organize around issues
- **RAG-based legislative assistant** - Ask questions about bills, voting history, and representatives in plain English
- **Constituent engagement tools** - Direct communication channels to representatives
- **Community organizing features** - Coordinate civic action at local and national levels

## Technical Architecture

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js, React, TypeScript |
| Backend | Python, FastAPI |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Hosting | Google Cloud Platform |
| Data Source | Congress.gov API |

The architecture is designed for scale - as civic engagement grows, the platform can handle increased load and expanded features.

## Why This Matters

Real change doesn't come from watching the news - it comes from showing up. Poly Sci Fi is infrastructure for civic participation:

- **Data over spin** - Real voting records, not partisan narratives
- **Action over outrage** - Tools to do something, not just feel something
- **Connection over isolation** - Find others who care about the same issues
- **Accountability over theater** - Track what representatives actually do

For Blacksky, Poly Sci Fi demonstrates capability in:
- **Full-stack development** - Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database
- **API integration** - Real-time data from government sources
- **Platform thinking** - Building for scale and community, not just features
- **Civic technology** - Technology that serves democratic participation
