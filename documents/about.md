# About Blacksky

## Who We Are

Blacksky LLC is a technology consulting firm specializing in AI solutions for federal agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Founded by Mario Moorhead, we bring 18+ years of enterprise experience to every engagement.

We architect and implement AI/ML capabilities - large language models, voice AI, translation services - into existing enterprise platforms while maintaining security compliance and operational excellence.

## What Makes Us Different

- **Production-focused**: We deploy to production, not just demos. Every solution is built for real-world scale and reliability.
- **Federal expertise**: Active security clearances and deep understanding of FISMA compliance and government security protocols.
- **Integration-first**: We work with your existing systems rather than requiring complete replacements.
- **Full ownership**: We handle everything from architecture through production deployment.
- **AI that fits**: We don't pitch AI for AI's sake. We architect solutions that work with your constraints - legacy platforms, compliance requirements, budget limits.

## Our Values

Inspired by Bruce Lee's philosophy: "Be like water making its way through cracks."

- **Adapt what is useful**: We embrace pragmatic solutions that solve real problems.
- **Reject what is useless**: No over-engineering. No technology for technology's sake.
- **Add what is your own**: Every engagement benefits from our unique combination of federal experience and AI expertise.

## Engineering Philosophy

- **Stability, Transparency, Precision**: We build modular systems that are easy to debug and document.
- **Local-First Development**: We mirror production environments from day one.
- **Resilient Infrastructure**: High-availability architectures with Redis clusters, Kubernetes, and 100% uptime focus.
