## Core Statement
“Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”
― Bruce Lee

## Key Principles & Values
* **[Principle 1]:** Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own..

* **[Principle 2]:** If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go toether. We can do anything if we work together.

* **[Principle 3]:** Don't fear failure. — Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.
